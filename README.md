# Ticklytoe

## Task 1 - Tic Tac Toe

Implement the game of Tic-Tac-Toe on the command line for two players:

- You are welcome to use online tutorials, e.g. [this one](http://robertheaton.com/2018/10/09/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners-3-a), for help.
- Develop the source code based on object-oriented programming.
- Design your software according to the model view controller (MVC) or model view presenter (MVP) architectural design pattern.
- Implement a feature to save the current game state in a file. Also, implement a feature to load a game state when opening the game.
- Add a second mode in which you play against a game AI. You can come up with your own heuristics for your game AI or implement the minimax algorithm.
- Write unit-tests for your business logic including your game AI. Utilize a test coverage tool and achieve at least 90% line coverage of your business logic.
- Use a profiler to identify slow parts of your business logic including your game AI. Try to speed them up.
- Follow the Python PEP8 coding style guide. Use a linter to ensure adherence.
- Use https://mygit.th-deg.de to manage the codebase.

### Report

The report should consist of the following parts:

1. Introduction
2. Architecture: Describe the design of your program by means of UML diagrams.
3. Serialization and deserialization: Explain how you save and load game states.
4. Game AI: Describe how your game AI works.
5. Tests: Describe your test approach and how you achieved at least 90% line coverage of your business logic.
6. Speed up: Explain how you identified slow parts of your business logic and your game AI and how you optimized them.
7. Conclusions and prospects: Summary and what else you could do in order to further improve your program.

## Task 2 - Chess (Optional)

Similarly to the requirements of Task 1, implement the game of Chess on the command line for two players. Implement alpha-beta pruning for your game AI.
